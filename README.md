## Using either the housing dataset

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting housing prices using the California housing dataset. The pipeline is implemented using scikit-learn and incorporates RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and a feature selection transformer.

## Project Structure:

data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.

notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and development.

src: Source code for the machine learning pipeline.
## dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhirajnirne/california-housing-data

data_preparation.py: Module for data preprocessing.

model.py: Module for defining and training the machine learning model.

pipeline.py: Module for creating the end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

tests: Unit tests for the pipeline.

requirements.txt: List of dependencies for the project.

## The machine learning pipeline consists of the following steps:

Data Preparation: The data_preparation.py module contains functions for loading and preprocessing the California housing dataset. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

Feature Selection: The pipeline includes a transformer that selects only the most important attributes from the dataset. This helps improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

Model Training: The model.py module defines a machine learning model (e.g., a regression model) using scikit-learn. The model is trained on the preprocessed data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: RandomizedSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning. This step optimizes the model hyperparameters to improve predictive performance.

Prediction: The final trained model is used to make predictions on new data.

## Using the customer churn dataset:

Reducing customer churn is crucial for the sustained success of a business. One effective way to address churn is by understanding customer behavior through cluster analysis. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Start by gathering relevant data on customer interactions, transactions, and any other pertinent information. Ensure the data is clean, and handle missing values appropriately.

## Define Churn:
Clearly define what constitutes churn for your business. This could be based on a lack of activity, cancellation of services, or other relevant metrics. Create a binary label for churn (1 for churned, 0 for active).

## Feature Selection:
Identify variables that may impact customer churn. These could include usage patterns, customer support interactions, subscription details, etc. Feature selection is crucial for accurate cluster analysis.

## Cluster Analysis:
Run a cluster analysis algorithm on the selected features. Common techniques include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN. The goal is to group customers with similar behavior together.

## Profile the Clusters:
Once clusters are formed, analyze each cluster's characteristics. Identify patterns and behaviors within each group. Understand what distinguishes one cluster from another, especially in terms of features related to churn.

## Churn Analysis:
Evaluate the churn rate within each cluster. This will help you identify which clusters have a higher likelihood of churning and which ones are more loyal. Look for patterns or commonalities among customers who churn within each cluster.

## Feature Importance:
Determine the importance of each feature in predicting churn within each cluster. This will provide insights into the factors that significantly contribute to customer attrition.

## Develop Strategies:
Based on the cluster profiles, develop targeted strategies to address churn within each group. Tailor marketing, customer service, or product offerings to meet the specific needs and preferences of each cluster.

## Implement Interventions:
Roll out interventions based on the developed strategies. This could involve targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, or improvements to customer support for specific clusters.
